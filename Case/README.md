# Notes

## Current case issue
- The case will disassemble when held in the wrong way, as it relies on gravity to keep it together. 
- Acrylic is a brittle material and succeptible to stress concentration, and was chosen for its optical properties (because it looked cool). If building for durability, another plastic or maybe even wood would be a better material. 

# Changelog

## v0.2
This version was created with the intent to get some pieces re-cut in Austin, TX  when they were damaged in transit. The helpful team at [MakeATX](https://www.makeatx.com/) was going to cut them, but in the end the scheduling didn't work out with such short notice. Superglue was used to fix the broken pieces instead. The new files fix several issues in the previous version, in particular with the inner holders:

- The inner dimension of the cubieboard holders now match the cubieboard. Previously, one of the nubs had to be manually removed as they were too close together.
- The inner dimension of the switch and powerpack holders have been slightly widenened as the originals were a very tight fit


## v0.1
The first version of the board, files prepared for [CutLaserCut](http://www.cutlasercut.com/) in London. There are several issues with the inner, thin holders of this version.
